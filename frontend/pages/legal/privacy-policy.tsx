      <h1>Butterfy Data Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Butterfy is a not-for-profit organization building a self-sustaining
        business model which does not rely on advertisement or any third-party
        investors or clients. Butterfy's only obligation is to its users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gives Butterfy the freedom of not having to collect unnecessary
        data. Your data privacy and security are a top concern for us. We treat
        your data with the utmost care and in accordance with the applicable
        laws and this privacy policy. Butterfy does not collect any data that is
        not absolutely needed and necessary for the respective purpose. We use
        servers in the European Union (Germany).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, some third-party services we are using (like Twitter, LinkedIn,
        Slack) have different business models and thus, different privacy
        policies. Please be aware that those services might try to collect data
        without us wanting that. Make sure you protect yourself by reading their
        terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can always <a href="/#footer ">contact</a> us and request insight
        into and deletion of your data. Or help us improve our policies.
      </p>
